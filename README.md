# Neural-Audio-Codec-with-Psychoacoustic-Calibration-Replication-of-Zhen-et-al.-2020-
This project replicates and extends "Psychoacoustic Calibration of Loss Functions for Efficient End-to-End Neural Audio Coding" (Zhen et al., 2020). It implements a neural audio codec using lightweight autoencoders, soft-to-hard quantization, SSE loss, mel-frequency loss, and priority weighting(psychoacoustic loss informed by masking thresholds).
